## Terminology

A glossary of common terms in the space.

## Core

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Chain | Examples of a chain (or blockchain) include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The blockchain is the underlining ledger. |
| Protocol | A smart contract embedded on the blockchain that handles the automation of transactions between parties, removing the need for an intermediary. For example, a protocol executes a set of functionality based on a set of met conditions such as valid sender, valid receiver, and sufficient funds. |
| Token (or Coin) | A transferable digital asset on a blockchain. They can be used for trading, storing value, governance, and even collectibles. They can come in various forms such as ERC-20 (common cryptocurrency), ERC-721 (NFT's), or ERC-1155 (a combination of the ERC-20 and ERC-721) |

### Sub-chain

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Block | Where the data of the blockchain is stored. The block stores the who, what, when, where, and how much of a transaction.  |
| Contract | Interactions with the blockchain to create transactions. |
| State Diff | Refers to any changes or differences in the storage data associated with a particular address. It typically represents modifications or updates made to the state of the blockchain at a given point in time. |
| Traces | All of the execution information within a transaction - the subexecution elements within the transaction. Ie. contracts would involve a series of subexecution steps to ultimate achieve the finalized transaction. |
| Transaction | Underlining activities related to the changes of state between wallets and contracts. |
| Transfers | Type of transactions whereby there are tokens transferred from one wallet to another - initiated via transaction. |
| Wallet | A cryptocurrency wallet is like a digital wallet for your cryptocurrency. It serves as an application where you store the passkeys required to authorize your crypto transactions. It also provides an interface for you to access and manage your digital assets, similar to how you use a physical wallet to store cash and cards. |

## Chain

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) | Software that creates smart contracts based on the Ethereum network. The EVM sits on top of Ethereum's hardware and node network layer. |
| Non-EVM | Non-EVM blockchains are the ones that do not follow the Ethereum principles and do not require continuous monitoring from a computation engine for executing smart contracts or other protocol procedures. |

### EVM

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Binance | A blockchain platform created by Binance that operates as a decentralized network. Binance uses a consensus mechanism called proof-of-stake to secure the network. It employs Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus algorithm to ensure network resilience and supports creation and management of cryptocurrencies, tokens, and NFTs. |
| Ethereum | A decentralized virtual machine network. It enables the creation and deployment of dApps and smart contracts, using Ether (ETH) as fuel for executing transactions and smart contracts. It's very popular for building DeFi applications, NFTs, and other blockchain-based services, and supports interoperability with other blockchain platforms. |
| Polygon | A blockchain network that offers faster and cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum. It is a Layer 2 scaling solution built on top of the Ethereum network, inheriting its security features. Offers tools and libraries such as Polygon.js and Polygon SDK to make it easier for developers to create and deploy dApps on the network. |

### Non-EVM

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Algorand | Algorand is a decentralized blockchain platform that utilizes a pure Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism to achieve high scalability and security. Algorand employs a Byzantine Agreement protocol that ensures consensus among participants without the need for a central authority. |
| Bitcoin | Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that was introduced in 2009 by an anonymous person. It is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. |
| NEAR | NEAR is a blockchain platform that operates on a sharded Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Sharding technology allows the network to process transactions and execute smart contracts in parallel, significantly increasing throughput and reducing latency. NEAR also implements a unique account model, where users can interact with dApps using their existing social media or email accounts, making blockchain adoption more accessible to mainstream users. |
| Stacks | Stacks is a decentralized computing platform that operates as a layer-1 blockchain protocol on top of the Bitcoin network. Stacks uses a unique consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Transfer (PoX), which leverages the security and stability of the Bitcoin blockchain. Stacks introduced a concept called "smart contracts as Clarity smart contracts," which enhances security and ensures the predictable execution of code on the blockchain. |
| Solana | Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications (dApps) and cryptocurrencies. It aims to provide fast transaction speeds, low fees, and scalability while maintaining decentralization and security. Solana was launched in 2020. |

### Token

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| ERC1155 | A technical standard for creating and managing multiple types of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Introduced as an improvement to the ERC20 and ERC721 standards. ERC1155 allows for the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens within the same smart contract. Includes batch transfers, allowing for multiple tokens to be transferred in a single transaction. The standard is widely used for creating gaming and collectible applications, as it allows for the creation of both fungible and non-fungible in-game items within the same smart contract. |
| ERC20 | ERC20 is a standard for creating tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. introduced in 2015 by Ethereum developer Fabian Vogelsteller as a way to establish a common set of rules for creating and managing tokens ERC20 tokens have a set of common functions, such as being able to transfer tokens between addresses and getting the total supply of tokens. ERC20 tokens can be created and managed by anyone with programming knowledge and access to the Ethereum network. ERC20 tokens can be stored in Ethereum wallets and traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. Many of the most popular cryptocurrencies, such as Tether (USDT) and Binance Coin (BNB), are ERC20 tokens. |
| ERC721 | ERC-721 is a widely used standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-721, short for Ethereum Request for Comment 721, defines a set of rules and guidelines that allow for the creation and interaction of unique, indivisible tokens on the Ethereum network. |
| Rebase | A mechanism or process that adjusts the total supply or circulating supply of a token based on a predefined formula or algorithm. The purpose of a rebase is typically to maintain price stability or to target a specific price or value for the token. |

### Protocol

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| CEX | CEX is shorthand for "centralized exchange." It is operated by a single company that manages assets in a centralized manner. |
| DEX | DEX is shorthand for "decentralized exchange." It uses smart contracts to enable trading. A decentralized exchange allows for peer-to-peer transfers without the use of an intermediary. |

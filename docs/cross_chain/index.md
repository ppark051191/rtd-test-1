# Cross Chain Share

Cross-chain refers to the interoperability or communication between different blockchain networks. It involves the ability to transfer or exchange digital assets, data, or information between separate blockchain ecosystems.

Each blockchain network typically operates independently with its own set of protocols, consensus mechanisms, and native assets. However, as the crypto industry has evolved, there is a growing need to connect these disparate blockchain networks to enable seamless interaction and the movement of assets between them.

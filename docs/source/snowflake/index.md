## Overview of Snowflake

Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehouse that allows end users to access data from various industries. Accessible data includes everything from national census data to individual account analytics from large companies like Stripe and ServiceNow.

Sonarverse has chosen Snowflake to house our data because of its unique capability to allow customers immediate access to our immense dataset. This enables us to deliver high-quality, real-time, and full historical data directly to our customers without the operational burden of transiting mass volumes of data across the network.

## What makes Snowflake unique

Traditional data warehouses demand that data partners and consumers store data separately, which can be a burdensome and time-intensive undertaking, especially with large data volumes. But with Snowflake, data shares can be stored in a centralized location, enabling both parties to securely access the data without having to worry about individual data storage. This one-of-a-kind capability not only reduces overall storage requirements but also enhances the efficacy of data partners and consumers in accessing their data.

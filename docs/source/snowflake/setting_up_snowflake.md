# Snowflake Data Share

### If you’re new to Snowflake, this guide will help you navigate through accessing your Sonarverse data share.

## Creating a Snowflake account

.. note::

   If you have perviously created a Snowflake account, skip this section and go to Accessing your data share.

To create a free Snowflake account, navigate to the [Snowflake website](https://signup.snowflake.com/?listing=GZSTZMA1Y0F).

You have now created a Snowflake account!

Move on to the next section to access your Sonarverse data share.

## Accessing your data share

To access your data share, there are two prerequisites you need to accomplish before you can proceed:

1. Ensure your account region is set to US_WEST_2 (Oregon).
2. Share your account identifier with Sonarverse.

If you’ve already done both steps, continue to the Getting your data section. If you haven’t, review the prerequisite section and complete the steps.

## Prerequisites

Navigate to your dashboard and on the bottom left, click on the eight-digit code next to the Snowflake logo.

You'll need to verify two main details to initiate data share:

1. **Cloud**: Amazon Web Services
2. **Region**: US West (Oregon)

Next, you must share your account identifier with Sonarverse. Hover over the account and click the copy button (circled in red) to copy your complete account identifier.

   For us to enable access to your data share, email this account identifier to us at onboarding@sonarverse.com.

## Getting your data

Once Sonarverse has granted you access to your data share, go back to your dashboard and navigate to the “Data” section on the left-hand side of the dashboard. Under data, go to private sharing to view your private data shares. Sonarverse’s data share should be visible to you. Click the blue “Get” button to save the data share.
